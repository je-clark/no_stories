# no_stories
Hide the stories feature on social media websites! Extension for Firefox

Only tested on one machine, so YMMV. I have a suspicion that Facebook dynamically changes class names; they seem randomly generated.

It should be available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-instagram-stories/) once Mozilla reviews the 2 lines of code, character by character.
