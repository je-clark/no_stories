# no_stories
Hide the stories feature on social media websites! Extension for Firefox

Only tested on one machine, so YMMV. I have a suspicion that Facebook dynamically changes class names; they seem randomly generated.

Extension is live! Get it [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-instagram-stories/).
